# SimpleWarrior


Simple Warrior will be, as the name suggests, a simple 8 bit rpg/adventure game. 
Although I have yet to make the graphics for the game, I have already done the basic foundation of the game. 
The game revolves around taking and completing quests from npcs. 
These quests mainly require the player to venture from the safety of their city into the dark forest in order to slay the growing number of enemies.
